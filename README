This is a group project effort of a two-player version of Conways Game of Life.
Each player starts off with 4 active cells in 10x10 grid.
In each round the player, whose turn it is, can kill an opponents cell and then activate a dead cell.
After that a new generation is generated and the turn ends.
The player who after a turn has no active cells left loses.
Have fun.
